Heil comrade Stalin!

Functionality:
- List available block devices (HDD, Flash drives etc.)
- List SMART parameters
- Perform tests:
--- Read
--- Write zeros
- Visualize results of tests
- Low-level device copying (not implemented yet)
Program is designed for adding more complex tests or recovery procedures,
and different front-ends.

To compile, just run ./build.sh and get 'whdd' executable binary in sources root dir.
Consider using with some nice .dialogrc, at last my Gentoo's libdialog defaults are ugly.
The one shipped in console_visualized_ui/recommended_.dialogrc is fine.
Place it in ~/.dialogrc, or /etc/dialogrc, or set its path with 'export DIALOGRC=...'
